A principal components analysis (PCA) was conducted on the 23 items with orthog-
onal rotation (varimax). The Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin measure verified the sampling
adequacy for the analysis KMO = .93 (‘superb’ according to Kaiser, 1974), and all
KMO values for individual items were > .77, which is well above the acceptable
limit of .5. Bartlett’s test of sphericity, χ2 (253) = 19,334, p < .001, indicated that
correlations between items were sufficiently large for PCA. An initial analysis was
run to obtain eigenvalues for each component in the data. Four components had
eigenvalues over Kaiser’s criterion of 1 and in combination explained 50.32% of the
variance. The scree plot was slightly ambiguous and showed inflexions that would
justify retaining both two and four components. Given the large sample size, and
the convergence of the scree plot and Kaiser’s criterion on four components, four
components were retained in the final analysis. Table 17.1 shows the factor loadings
after rotation. The items that cluster on the same components suggest that compo-
nent 1 represents a fear of computers, component 2 a fear of statistics, component
3 a fear of maths and component 4 peer evaluation concerns.
